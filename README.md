Scan&Carry is a web application that scans the text from product images, extracts the ingredients list, provides a description of the ingredients, and gives a health score based on the effect of the ingredients on health.

## Project Setup

### 1. Problem Statement
Our Problem:

In today's world, we are facing a multitude of ecological crises that threaten the health of our planet and its inhabitants. While adopting conservation habits is crucial, many of us wonder if individual actions alone will be sufficient to mitigate these pressing issues.

Similar to the revelation about the significant environmental impact of animal agriculture, there is a growing awareness of the importance of understanding the ingredients used in the products we use daily. Just as livestock production contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and resource consumption, the chemicals and components in various consumer products can also have profound effects on both human health and the environment.

Consider this: while the world's population continues to grow exponentially, so does the demand for food and consumer goods. With global food production projected to increase substantially in the coming decades, there is a pressing need to address the issue of food wastage and loss, which not only results in significant economic costs but also exacts a heavy toll on the environment.

Moreover, research has shown that certain ingredients commonly found in cosmetics, cleaning products, and food items can have adverse effects on human health. From allergens and irritants to potentially harmful chemicals, being informed about the ingredients in these products is essential for making informed choices that promote both personal well-being and environmental sustainability.

Our application aims to address this need by providing users with comprehensive information about the ingredients used in a wide range of products and their potential effects on health. By empowering individuals with knowledge and awareness, we can collectively work towards a healthier and more sustainable future for ourselves and the planet.

Scan&Carry aims to solve the challenge of understanding the health implications of the ingredients in our everyday products. It provides an easy way for users to get detailed information about the ingredients just by uploading an image of the product.

### Our Solution?

### 3. Architecture

Our solution adopts a client-server architecture to develop the Sustainable Consumer Assistant App, with clear separation between the backend and frontend components. This architecture facilitates efficient data processing, storage, and user interaction, ensuring a seamless and intuitive experience for users.
High-Level Components:

1.Backend:
   - Responsible for data processing, storage, and business logic.
   - Manages user authentication, product information retrieval, and environmental impact analysis.
   - Implements APIs to facilitate communication with the frontend and external services.
   - Comprises three main modules:
     - Gemini Pro Module: This module handles image recognition and content generation using Google's Generative AI model (Gemini Pro). It processes uploaded images to identify products and extract relevant information.
     - OCR Module: The Optical Character Recognition (OCR) module performs text extraction from uploaded images. It converts images containing text into machine-readable data, facilitating further analysis.
     - Recommendation Module: This module analyzes user preferences, product data, and environmental impact metrics to generate personalized product recommendations. It leverages machine learning algorithms to suggest sustainable alternatives to users.

2. Frontend:
   - Provides the user interface for the Sustainable Consumer Assistant Web-App.
   - Enables users to upload product images for recognition, view sourcing and manufacturing details, and assess environmental impacts.
   - Implements features for user engagement, such as community forums, educational resources, and gamification elements.
   - Ensures a seamless and intuitive user experience across various devices and platforms.
   - Comprises two main interfaces:
     - Recommendation Interface: This interface displays recommended products based on user preferences and analysis of environmental impact. It presents users with sustainable alternatives to promote responsible consumption.
     - OCR Extraction Interface: Allows users to extract text information from uploaded images using OCR technology. This feature enhances the accessibility of product information and facilitates informed decision-making.

Technologies, Programming Languages, and Tools Used:
Backend:
- Framework: Python is chosen for its simplicity, versatility, and extensive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.
- Database: SQLITE is utilized for its lightweight nature and ease of integration with Python applications.
- APIs: RESTful APIs are implemented to enable seamless communication between the backend, frontend, and external services such as Gemini Pro Vision.
- Data Processing: Python libraries such as Google's Generative AI and Pytesseract are employed for image recognition and OCR functionality, respectively.
